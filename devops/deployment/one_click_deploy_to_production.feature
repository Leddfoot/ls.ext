Feature: One click deploy to production
  As system owner
  In order to reduce likelihood of human error during deployment
  I want an easily triggered automated deployment mechanism

  Provisioning:
  - Master/minion
  - Masterless salt (?)
  - Vagrant + masterless salt (?)

  How to trigger
  - Run command on salt master
  - Jenkins(?)

  Scenario: Deployment of DB to wombat
